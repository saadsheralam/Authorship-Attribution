# Authorship-Attribution

The project aims to analyze and evaluate the performance of kNN, Neural Networks, and Ensemble Methods for authorship attribution tasks. The project also explores different feature representations for the aforementioned models. The first half of the project evaluates these models for Bag-of-Words (TF-IDF) features and the second half focuses on word embeddings. The dataset comprises of the following twitter handles used as authors: <br>
- @WSJ
- @CNN
- @Ubisoft
- @SHAQ
- @juniorbachchan
- @SpursOfficial

The attribution data consists of the last 1000 tweets for each twitter handle scraped using public twitter APIs. Note that the repository only containsscript for the twitter handle @SpursOfficial. Same script can be used to obtain data for the rest of the authors. Final collected and cleaned data across all twitter handles has also been uploaded.
